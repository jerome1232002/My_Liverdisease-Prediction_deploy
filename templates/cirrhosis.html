<li><p style="color:indigo">Being Overweight</p>Being obese increases your risk of conditions that may lead to cirrhosis, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</li>
<li><p style="color:indigo">Having viral hepatitis.</p> Not everyone with chronic hepatitis will develop cirrhosis, but it's one of the world's leading causes of liver disease.</li>
<h2><p style="color:magenta">Prevention</h2></p>
<li>Do not drink alcohol if you have cirrhosis. If you have liver disease, you should avoid alcohol.</li>
<li>Eat a healthy diet. Choose a plant-based diet that's full of fruits and vegetables. Select whole grains and lean sources of protein. Reduce the amount of fatty and fried foods you eat.</li>
<li>Maintain a healthy weight. An excess amount of body fat can damage your liver. Talk to your doctor about a weight-loss plan if you are obese or overweight.</li>
<li>Reduce your risk of hepatitis. Sharing needles and having unprotected sex can increase your risk of hepatitis B and C. Ask your doctor about hepatitis vaccinations</li>
